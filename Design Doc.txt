Project Design Document- Munchkin

Munchkin is a multiplayer card-based competitive dungeon-crawl for 3 to 6 players.  

Cards
Two generic types of cards: Treasure and Door.  These will be how the cards are separated into decks at the beginning of the game.

Card Management
Decks – Each deck has a “face-up” discard pile.  When a deck runs out, reshuffle the discards.  If both are empty, no more draws can be done.

Player Hand – Cards in the player’s hand are NOT in play.  Limit 5 cards unless race is dwarf (limit 6).  

Carried Items – Items not in hand that have bonuses to assist the player.  Those items not helping you should be “turned sideways”, and do not give the player bonuses.

Equipped - You may only use one headgear, one suit of armor, one footwear, and two “hand” items OR one “two hands” item.  UNLESS you have a card that says otherwise.  

Player

Players must have counters from 1 to 10 to count levels (method of winning).  This must be able to go up and down as the cards  or player actions deem.  Player level can not drop below 1.  Reaching level 10 wins the game.  If two players get there at the same time, they both win.

Players start as a level 1 human with “no class”, and must have an associated gender – male or female.  Race and class cards can modify their respective quality on the player (if played), and each can have its own benefits and penalties.
