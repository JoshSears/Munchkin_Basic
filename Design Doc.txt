Project Design Document- Munchkin

Munchkin is a multiplayer card-based competitive dungeon-crawl for 3 to 6 players.  

Cards
Two generic types of cards: Treasure and Door.  These will be how the cards are separated into decks at the beginning of the game.

Card Management
Decks – Each deck has a “face-up” discard pile.  When a deck runs out, reshuffle the discards.  If both are empty, no more draws can be done.

Player Hand – Cards in the player’s hand are NOT in play.  Limit 5 cards unless race is dwarf (limit 6).  
Carried Items – Items not in hand that have bonuses to assist the player.
